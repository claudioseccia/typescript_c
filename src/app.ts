//CH5
//CLASSES AND INTERFACES
//Working with objects
//****************************************
//5.3 Creating a fist class
//convention is to start with uppercase char for class names
//ES6 syntax:
// class Department {
//   name: string;
//   //constructor() is executed when the object is created
//   constructor(n: string) {
//     this.name = n;
//   }
// }
// //create a first object based on the class "blueprint":
// const accounting = new Department("Accounting");
// console.log(accounting);

//****************************************
//5.4 Compiling to javascript
//changing to ES5 into tsconfig ("target": "ES5"), it will change in the compilation with the old ES5 syntax

//****************************************
//5.5 Constructor functions and the this keywork

// class Department {
//   //PROPERTIES
//   name: string;
//   //CONSTRUCTOR
//   //constructor() is executed when the object is created
//   constructor(n: string) {
//     this.name = n;
//   }
//   //METHOD
//   describe() {
//     //the this keywork make accessible all the properties inside the whole class
//     console.log("Department: " + this.name);
//   }
//   workingDescribe(this: Department) {
//     console.log("Department: " + this.name);
//   }
// }
// //create a first object based on the class "blueprint":
// const accounting = new Department("Accounting");
// accounting.describe();
// console.log(accounting);

// const accountingCopy = { describe: accounting.describe };
// accountingCopy.describe(); //returns undefined for this.name inside describe() method

// const accountingCopyWorking = {
//   name: "DUMMY",
//   workingDescribe: accounting.workingDescribe,
// };
// accountingCopyWorking.workingDescribe(); //not working??
