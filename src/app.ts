//CH 7 - GENERICS
//****************************************
//7.1 Generics
//generics exist in typescript but not in javascript
//1.What are generics
//2.Generic function and classes
//3.Constraints
//4.Special Typescript Types

//****************************************
//7.2 - Built-in Generics & What are Generics

//GIVES MORE INFORMATION FOR CERTAIN TYPES
//ex. an array is a combination of various values
// const names = ["Max", "Manu"]; //in this case it's an array of strings
//const names: string[] = ["Max", "Manu"]; //same as above, forced
// const names: Array = ["Max", "Manu"]; //ERROR !!! require at least one type
// const names: any[] = ["Max","Manu",2]; //Ugly but works
// const names: Array<string> = ["Max", "Manu"]; //WORKS! -- same as const names: string[] = ...
/*
const names: Array<string | number> = ["Max", "Manu", 2]; //WORKS (union types) - Array<any> <-- to set any type

//PROMISE TYPE
//here we tell typesctipt that we have a Promise that resolves in a string
const promise: Promise<string> = new Promise((resolve) => {
  //we typically set as --> new Promise(resolve,reject)
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("This is done");
  }, 2000);
});

promise.then((data) => {
  data.split(" ");
});
//if we set:
//const promise: Promise<number> = new Promise((resolve) => {
//and
//resolve(10);
//typescript will give error on: data.split(" "); --> split is a type only for strings
*/
//****************************************
//7.3 - Creating a Generic Function
/*
//ex. function that takes as a param two objects and returns an object
function merge(objA: object, objB: object) {
  return Object.assign(objA, objB);
}
console.log(merge({ name: "Max" }, { age: 20 }));
const mergedObject = merge({ name: "Max" }, { age: 20 });
// console.log(mergedObject.name); //ERROR!!!   typescript doesn't know the type of the returned values
// console.log(mergedObject.age); //ERROR!!!   typescript doesn't know the type of the returned values
// we can do type casting as like: 
//const mergedObject = merge({ name: "Max" }, { age: 20 }): as {name: string, age:number};
//but it's cumbersome. Here's another solution: GENERICS
*/
//SOLUTION: <GENERICS>
//since "object" as a type is a highly un-specified type
//in this Generic assignment T and U are treated as any possible value extending object. Typescript automatically infers
function merge<T extends object, U extends object>(objA: T, objB: U) {
  //optional (TS automatically infers): ...(objA: T, objB: U): T & U
  return Object.assign(objA, objB);
}
const mergedObject = merge(
  { name: "Max", hobbies: ["sport", "develpment"] },
  { age: 30 }
);
//not necessary! TS automatically infers values from generic types:
// const mergedObject = merge<{name: string, hobbies: string[]},{age: number}>({ name: "Max", hobbies: ["sport", "develpment"] },{ age: 30 });
console.log("mergedObject age:", mergedObject.age); //WORKS!
console.log("mergedObject age:", mergedObject.hobbies); //WORKS!
//THIS GIVES A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY, CREATING GENERIC TYPES TO ACCESS ANY PROPERTY INSIDE THE OBJECT

const mergedObject2 = merge({ name: "Frank" }, { age: 20 });
console.log("mergedObject2 name:", mergedObject2.name); //WORKS!
